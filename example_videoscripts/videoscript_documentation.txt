god

i've been stuck in limbo for the last 10
0:22
years
0:23
not knowing whether i'll get deported
0:26
whether i'll be able to work again and
0:28
live a normal life like everybody else
0:30
around me
0:31
i've been left in the dark
0:36
i arrived in the uk when i was nine
0:38
years old from zimbabwe
0:40
escaping an abusive household i was
0:43
granted temporary right to remain whilst
0:46
i was a child
0:48
since then my work permit has been taken
0:50
from me
0:51
and the home office has spent five years
0:53
deciding my fate
0:55
i haven't been able to go to university
1:00
i'm not eligible for any governmental
1:02
support
1:05
[Music]
1:10
before my work permit was taken away i
1:12
used to work in the nhs
1:15
up and down and across the west midlands
1:18
and now i can't work at all
1:20
[Music]
1:23
i don't think the government cares about
1:25
me to them i'm just another number and
1:27
name
1:28
in an already backlogged system
1:31
with an ever-growing queue of people in
1:33
the same position as me
1:36
my earliest memories my first of
1:38
everything we're here
1:39
the first time i played football first
1:42
time i kissed a girl
1:44
my friends my family all i know is
1:47
england
1:49
but they don't see it that way any other
1:51
memories are of
1:54
a dark time in my life
1:58
that i try not to think about
2:03
if i could speak directly to the
2:04
government right now
2:07
i'd only asked him not to outcast me to
2:09
look past my skin tone
2:12
and just see me as a human being
2:16
five years since the last decision
2:20
and i'm still waiting how am i meant to
2:23
survive without a work permit
2:26

2:30

2:34
supposed to do
2:39
i had no options and in the streets
2:42
there is no room for morality when
2:45
you're trying to survive
2:48
it's the lord a jungle you either adapt
2:52
or die being in the streets is
2:58
constantly being on edge always looking
3:01
over your shoulder

3:15
it's a nightmare
3:20
how would you go from working in the
3:21
early chess to being forced to the
3:30
streets
3:32
music and hip-hop have been a lifeline
3:36
to me
3:37
when every physical freedom has been
3:39
stripped away from me
3:40
it doesn't matter what part of the
3:42
social ladder you in what race you are
3:45
what gender you are it's a love of a
3:48
culture
3:49
it's unifying
3:52
and the world needs a lot more of that
3:54
right now
3:56
my soul is in every lyric and in every
3:59
word
4:01
music the heart of rap
4:06
specifically hip-hop
4:09
is the voice for the voiceless
4:19
orphan child of the colonial empire rape
4:22
a motherland and abandoned her to save
4:24
face

4:26
your place seeking refuge in a maternal
4:29
embrace
