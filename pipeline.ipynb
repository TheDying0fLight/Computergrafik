            "hey everybody I'm West from PC Gamer I'm a senior editor there and last week I was one of the first six people in the world to fly to from software's offices in Tokyo to play an early build of Elden ring night rain I will note that we weren't allowed to do gameplay capture of night rain and I didn't get any b-roll either so most of the footage that you're going to see here maybe just some kind of generic stock footage uh of Elden ring itself just note that you're not getting an extensive look at night rain itself now that's going to have to wait until later a three-player co-op Rog likee set in the world of Elden ring that is probably not what you expected from from software who are famous for their high stakes High difficulty RPGs but Elden ring night rain is a turbo mode reinterpretation of the combat that from software has been refining across the last 10 years of games the new features in this Rog likee uh teased in a trailer at the 2024 game awards are a bit hard to wrap your head around until you've actually played it but I have and I'm here to tell you all about it it is a three-player co-op game set in an alternate universe version of Elden Rings game world it's hard to get a real good feel for what you're looking at in that trailer it probably left you with way more questions than answers um but I got to play the game for a good six or seven hours so I have still some questions but a lot more answers uh so I'm going to give you a first look at night rain how it plays what about it is exciting and what about it wasn't fully convincing right out of the gate let's break down the key details one Elden ring night rain is a three-player co-op Rog like in night rain you play as a member of a three-player co-op team exploring a familiar but different version of limb grave Elden ring starting zone the map has a static overall layout but with sort of like a DJ Mix approach to the weapons you find and the enemies you encounter they're going to be random and jumbled up every game before each run you'll choose a final boss to go after almost like you're picking a creature to hunt in Monster Hunter but before you fight them you have to survive two days of exploration and combat with each day ending in a big boss fight of its own so in the build of the game I played the first night I would either end up fighting a pair of demihumans or a big centipede monster while KN two was either marget the Fel Omen all of you are very familiar with him if you played Elden ring or a tree Sentinel with a couple of couple of lesser Riders but still very scary Knights uh riding alongside him so as an Elden ring you can be matched with random players for the multiplayer or you can use a multiplayer password system to party up with your friends two night rain will be a premium priced not free-to-play game from software told me they don't consider night Rain To Be Live service they want a full game experience in the box so to speak and that means updates after launch are still an open question Bandai Namco who is the publisher did confirm for me that you won't need to own Elden ring to play it night rain is totally Standalone and the price will be comparable to shadow of the ER tree this year's expansion which probably means $40 but that's not confirmed basically the takeaway is this is not a full $60 or $70 priced game three you'll play as predefined characters so yeah there's no character creator in night rain unlike basically all of from software's RPGs night rain does not let you create a custom character though you will unlock alternate skins for the cast of eight preset characters as you progress through the game night rain is going for the hero route with predefined characters I get to play with four of them but there will be eight total in the final game so in the build that I played there was Wilder who is an armored Knight who resembles kind of like the canonical box art character from a lot of the souls games it's got a hefty long sword and a really cool high Mobility grappling hook there's also Duchess who's a speedy kind of scout like character in near automatic cosplay equipped with a magic dagger Duchess Dodges with an elegant side step rather than the usual rooll and an incredibly powerful ability that lets her redeal the last few seconds of damage that both you and your allies have done to a nearby enemy all over again it's really really effective with Team coordination and really satisfying to pull off there's also Guardian who's kind of like a birdman he was the tankiest of the characters that I played as whose ultimate ability has him fly up into the air before performing this huge dive bomb aack back to the ground which deals damage in a wide area and boosts your allies defense for a little bit this is a really clutch move you can use it to both deal damage and revive your allies at the same time a funny Quirk of night rain is that you actually revive your allies by attacking them rather than holding like a a revive button the way a lot of games do it and the fourth character that I got to play as was the recluse who's a very frail Mage the most complex character of the bunch who I spent the least amount of time with as a result because I didn't want to uh constantly be dying while I was playing um but I think doubtless will be very powerful in the hands of skilled Players Once people have a lot of time to actually tuck in the night rain so the recluse has the ability to absorb elements from enemies which sounds a little confusing but it's based on kind of the last thing that's hit them what Elemental Affinity that that attack might have whether it's bleed poison fire ice Etc she can basically absorb those Essences and then after absorbing a certain number and storing them up can unleash them in a special attack that changes based on what you've absorbed so you can see that's like not going to be the easiest character to just immediately take control of and know what you're doing but I'm sure the payoff will be there uh once you do and there are four more characters in addition to those four including one who's an Archer and one built around uh parrying combat like seiro or the crystal hard tier from the shadow of the earth tree expansion but from software are keeping tight lipped about those Heroes for now and there are two more that we don't know anything about number four night rain is not a battle royale but yeah it kind of looks like one when I first saw this trailer at from software's offices I thought what what the heck is this a battle royale and yeah night rain is borrowing the popular Battle Royale mechanic of a danger zone ring shrinking to a focal point on the map as you play so at first glance like it looks like it's going to be a PVP game uh you even drop into the map from the sky on like a spectral Raven so it kind of feels like you're jumping off the fortnite party bus or you know descending onto a map in Apex Legends The fortnite Vibes are very strong in this game right uh but no it is not a battle royale game in fact it is even less of a PVP game than Elden ring or Dark Souls there is no Invasion mechanic in night rain you cannot fight against other players at all so the Battle Royale ring is just there to kind of to limit the amount of time you can spend leveling up by fighting enemies and push you towards boss right confrontations at the end of each day so the days will only last about 10 minutes before you have to do a big boss fight and then assuming you've survived uh the first day the circle will recede closes back in again on you on the second day and if you survive day two then you go on to fight your ultimate Hunt Target the the final boss for your run so this is definitely not Elden Ring 2 I'd say it actually has more of the feel of a very very ambitious mod for Elden ring than it does a you know a full-on sequel cuz it is not an RPG number five so what does Elden ring night rain actually play like well in many ways night rain plays exactly like Elden ring weapons and basic enemies have the exact move sets they do in the base game controls are essentially the same with just a few additions all of Elden Rings battle mechanics are there backstabs guard parries two handing weapons etc etc etc if you've played a Souls game if you play Elden ring it's going to feel super familiar immediately in other ways night rain feels extremely different from Elden ring movement speed and sprinting are greatly sped up even without the spectral Steed Mount you're far more Mobile in this game you can mantle up most most Cliffs and Vault up Ledges there is no fall damage like at all no fall damage because each run of the game has a fairly strict time limit you're also encouraged to just play at a Breakneck Pace running from place to place to get as much loot as you can kill as many enemies as possible and level up at sights of Grace which are scattered around the map so that when you get to a boss fight which are unsurprisingly big difficult these spikes you're as strong as you can possibly be so it it feels so different from playing uh a regular Souls game or even ELD and ring enemies quickly become trash mobs right so you're just kind of running up to a bunch of enemies and just absolutely tearing through them as you level up very quickly so that makes the combat feel really different than it does in the souls games where every new room you go into uh for a good chunk of the game is likely to present some new threat that you're not expecting and keep you kind of constantly on your toes so I really enjoyed night rain and also found it a bit awkward to play cuz you're definitely losing some of that tension some of the elegance and like sense of significance from Discovery in the original version of Elden ring and in the souls games where you're going on this long RPG Journey and it feels weird to see all of these really familiar pieces just kind of thrown in the sandbox together and like turned into new toys to play with at the same time it still plays really well right like those fundamentals of from software combat that they've been refining across their games they're still great and it's hard to argue against how fun it is to just put that whole experience on fast forward and be playing for kind of low stakes compared to uh a classic from software game right like you're not gring when you die in this game because you've just lost so much progress It's not that big of a deal so I found myself immediately wanting to jump into another round at pretty much at the end of every single match just cuz I was excited to see what kind of stuff was going to happen in the next run and what kind of random drops I was going to get that would define how I built my character so yeah let's let's talk about that randomization number six is the map randomly generated and how much does it change the layout of night rain's map is static kind of it looks like a jump bubled Up remix of limb grave with familiar caves forts uh wizard towers ruins uh jails all in different places than they were in the original game and from software says that that General topography and the location of structures will stay fixed like the map is the map but the developer also being KY about the extent to which it can change on different runs so from software told me that sometimes an environmental modifier will appeal on the map so this could be like uh a swamp or a lava spewing volcano I didn't encounter these kind of big random environmental elements so I can't say how significant they're going to be for the game as a whole how much it'll affect the overall layout and feel of the map um how much they'll kind of come to dominate a run if at all or how many like varieties of these surprises are going to be in the randomization pool for the final game um in my interview from software also hinted at the fact that the environmental changes like might be tied to the sort of meta stories for the different characters you can play as so there's a lot we don't know here yet about kind of how all of this stuff is going to play together the enemies and the bosses you encounter at each place of interest you know each Fort and so on uh will vary by session which is clearly what from software is kind of relying on to be the main thing that keeps combat fresh and keeps playing the game multiple times exciting um because they they want that to be unpredictable across many runs even if the overall shap of the map you know stays basically the same I think there's a risk there with this design of the map feeling I guess like a bit too much of a drag to explore in a PVA PVE game if it remains static even if you encounter a different boss at the ruins you've run around 30 times before I don't know that that's going to be as exciting as it is playing a PVP Battle Royale game where yes you could can get tired of the map the environment to some extent but there's just so much more unexpected behavior from other human players it's it's so much more Dynamic to be in that PVP environment in a in a place that you know very well than it is in a PVE game where you kind of know how the enemies are going to behave even if you run into this type of soldier in a fort versus you know this type of uh Undead for example but again I played one day of an early build of this game which clearly did not have every you know random and procedural element all active at once so it's really not enough to see how everything's going to fit together in the final game there will definitely be some randomized surprises um across the day that I played night rain uh for example marget the Fel Omen was one of the potential KN two bosses but also sometimes invaded our play session unexpectedly in the middle of the day and started just chasing us across the map number seven the loot system resembles a lot of other action RPGs if you've played a Souls game if you played elen ring you know that these games have literally hundreds of weapons in them and I only ever used a hand full of them in a given playthrough uh which was kind of a bummer but night the way night rain simplifies stats and makes it so that just about every character can use every weapon so you can assemble a viable build on the Fly pretty much every run and you are not locked into playing in a particular way even if you choose a character who kind of by default is a bit tankier or a bit uh faster paced so regular enemies and bosses around the map will drop randomized loot as in other action RPGs that loot can include passive skills like stat Buffs can also include active effects and affinities like poison bleed ice fire attacks and more uh loot is abundant there are tons of chests and breakable objects in the environment that house weapons and consumable items like oils to coat your sword for extra damage uh daggers that you can throw for range damage Etc so when you kill a boss you usually get to choose from three loot options with one of those options being like a kind of a permanent well or permanent within theun character option rather rather than a uh weapon upgrade so for example that could be like a 15% bonus to damage reduction for the rest of the run regular drops are shared between players so you could open a chest and then someone could just run up and grab the items right from under your nose um but the more valuable drops from bosses are individualized loot is tiered with color-coded Rarity so if you play Diablo or like any MMO you'll basically know the just there and ELD Ring's old inventory system is gone it's much uh simplified in night rain you can only hold six weapons uh three in your right hand and three in your left hand and the passive skills on weapons that you pick up actually remain active as long as they're in your inventory so that means you could pick up a great sword that you don't want to use because you're doing kind of like a a fast-paced dagger build but you want to keep it in your inventory anyway because it happens to offer like a nice buff to your Poise stat so you're sort of creating a build just by picking and choosing which weapons and items you pick up as you go number eight there will be meta progression in the form of character stories and permanent loot from each run in between runs you're going to return to an alternate version of Elden Rings Round Table hold where you can chat with all of the characters except for the one that you're currently embodying practice using their abilities in a training ground and make use of some kind of upgrade system that was not accessible in the build that we played each character in night rain has these Relic slots that you can equip random uh end ofun rewards to so these offer some really substantial benefits they're hell you're going to improve your characters long term uh one Relic for example gave me plus two Vigor made my healing flasks actually heal my allies in addition to myself which was really really beneficial uh another marked treasure for me on the map and boosted magic attacks and enhanced uh specifically one of the duchess's character abilities so there's going to be a lot of variation between these these relics and it seems like you're probably going to get more Relic slots as you play through the game just based on the the the UI that's speculation on my part but uh it it kind of makes sense because from software told me there's going to be some degree of narrative progression for the characters as well so it sounds like moving those through those stories is probably going to give you some sort of progression not just in how the characters um stories play out but also in what bosses you can fight or how the map changes all of this stuff was left pretty un unclear they clearly don't want to kind of spoil everything up front um but I do get the sense that there's going to be some sort of longer term evolution in the game Beyond just having these three slots that you can put uh slightly better items into number nine night rain really isn't an RPG now leveling is way simplified just like the the combat and the movement now leveling is really fast in night rain you still Level Up by uh killing enemies to acrw runes and then spending those runes at a sight of Grace Just Like An Elden ring um but you acrw them very quickly and instead of leveling up an individual stat every chunk of runes you spend will grant you one level kind of just overall and that will boost your stats across the board stat growth is different for each character so like The Duchess and the recluse are always going to have less Health than Guardian for example um if you're downed by an enemy your teammates will have a short time amount of time to revive you before you die and then if you do bleed out you'll still respawn nearby but you'll lose all the runes you were carrying like in Elden ring and you will Del by one level that's something a little bit different um but as an Elden ring you can still re reclaim your runes by returning to the scene of your death although an enemy may have picked up your runes and will be holding them hostage until you kill them your character does not have any kind of meta level so you're back to level one at the start of each run that you go into but there are some meta progression elements like the ones I alluded to before number 10 all right finally when can you play it so like Elden ring in most of the souls games from sof is planning to hold a free online beta test Network test for players sometime ahead of release we don't know when but it's obviously going to be next year sometime based on their past games expect the network test to be held between 3 and 6 months before release elen ring was about 10 weeks ahead of release while Dark Souls II was about 5 months ahead so there's quite a range there we'll find out more in 2025 so what features are you most excited about what characters are you going to play as first let us know in the comments and make sure you Subs subcribe so you can stay up to

            "in this video we're going to be taking a look at Elden ring night rain if you haven't heard at the game awards from software and B and Amco unveiled that there is going to be a spin-off of Elden ring it's a standalone title that focuses on Cooperative action adventure play and in this video we're going to go through that trailer that was released and talk about everything that we've learned there have been several interviews of people that have got to play the game mostly press Outlets we're going to go through what we learned from that as well and kind of fill you in on what exactly this game is so the first thing that we know about the game is it's very heavily Cooperative based meaning that you're supposed to take on the game with up to two other players and in fact if you look through the gameplay footage you can see that they have similar characters in just about every scene and just about every scene has more than one character so the game has a heavy focus on playing through the game and probably playing with like your friends does seem like you'll probably be able to play with random players as well but I think there's going to be more of a focus with night rain on playing cooperatively with people you know rather than just picking up randoms in general although probably you still can and because you see a lot of similar looking characters in each scene and each one of them seems to have like a very distinct appearance they seem to have very distinct skills it's like the hawk character like flying up in the air and crashing down another character like jumping up and slamming one character doing like a charge shot with their bow a lot of people have been theorizing that this is going to be like a hero focused game or that players will be able to select from a a roster of characters and play one of them and that does seem to be indeed the case if you look on the bandam website it does say that you're going to pick from specific characters with different skills and abilities that seem to progress as you move through the game and if you look at some of the interviews it sounds like there were four playable characters in The build that they played one of them was like an all-around hero that had a balance between speed and attack power there was a guardian type character that was kind of tanky with heavy attacks The Duchess was Nimble and fast with a quick step ability and the ReUse was a mage type with ranged magical attacks I think from what I read that there were supposed to be eight characters in total so this would be half of them that are playable in the game and one thing that was mentioned is that it seems like the game was designed with future updates be able to add more characters to choose from and play with and it does look like the game is going to take place in the Elden ring universe or more specifically a densely packed alternate reality chunk of limb grave so it seems like there's going to be you're going to be playing inside the limb grave Zone and it's going to be like a lot of you know different things than we would normally see in the very base game of Elden ring with you know different placements of castles and Forts and things like that lots of enemies so you should be kind of familiar with the area and the look of the area but it's going to be different than you remember and it seems like the general structure of the game follows a 3-day cycle with each day taking roughly about 15 minutes to complete so theoretically one gameplay session is going to take you 45 minutes and at the beginning you're going to be able to start out and head in any direction that you want to go you can hidden things on the map and go explore prove your character by finding gear or leveling up improving your abilities Etc but as the game turns toight apparently things get dicier the game gets harder like more there's like something called like an acid rain that appears and it seems like the map shrinks more and more until there's a point where you get a random boss summons and you face that boss so once you defeat that boss my understanding is that the day and night cycle were repeat being able to explore once again with night closing in things get dicey and shrink and then you fight a second boss that's harder and then this repeats again for a third boss and again these bosses are randomized some of them have been said to be bosses from Elden ring like the demium queen or demium swordmaster or the dronic tree Sentinel it you're not sure which boss you're going to get there's also new bosses besides ones that have been shown in Elden ring so there will be new bosses it's not just old bosses but something interesting is you see the nameless King as one of the bosses in here which makes me wonder if we won't see returning bosses from Dark Souls 3 or maybe some of the other Souls games as well and something you may notice in the game play almost immediately when looking at it is that characters move differently in Elden ring night rain than they do in the base game they can move way way more quickly they can Sprint fast even in boss fights apparently there is no equip loader weight management in the game and this allows you to just move at top speed all the time kind of like seciro or something like that you also see a character that kind of like jumps off a wall grabs onto a ledge Etc so exploration is going to be much faster I think the idea here is they want you to be able to explore a lot before night falls and you can't explore as much and you get into a boss fight so by moving quickly andove eliminating equip load late you're going to be able to be at top speed all the time and another thing that was mentioned about player characters compared to Elden ring is that it seems like they have skills and ultimate skills that may have cooldowns instead of like a resource you know that they need in order to cast so you're not going to be able to spam them each character supposedly also has an ultimate attack that they can use so you know you're going to use those at Timely moments and my guess is you know a big part of this game is going to be you know using your resources or using these like ultimate skills at the right moment you know holding your health flasks for the right moments Etc so as a team you're going to have to collectively decide like when's the best moment for each character to use their ultimate attack and if you're starting to think that this game sounds a little bit like a Rog like I think that's pretty spot-on from what I've seen so far from the interviews and stuff people are describing the game as a rogue likee where you do a run and then if you successfully complete it you do another run and it seems like there are eight like major bosses in the game or something like this where after you get to the third night the final boss that you face will be you know whatever highest one you haven't defeated yet and then you know you'll continue progressing forward through the game like that so if you hear that the game itself is quite a bit different than Elden ring like it's it's obviously set in the same universe has similar um itemization and weapons and and things like that and obviously some of the weapon skills whatever but it is a completely different type of game than we've seen in Elden ring and Elden ring Shadow the Earth tra and another thing that was mentioned is that new weapons in the game are either found in treasure chest or from drops after fights so it seems like they're going to be a bit randomized in your playthrough and from what I understand people were saying this system is either kind of like Destiny or kind of like Diablo in terms of the itemization doesn't sound like each run is going to have the same items or weapons for you to find it may be that there are like a variety of different possible ways the map could load and maybe they're in the specific places if you get that map load out I don't know for sure but it does sound like the weapons and stuff are going to be somewhat randomized now this is where the game gets interesting in my opinion because from software has come out and said that this is not a live service game that it's not going to be like any battle pass or microtransactions or anything like that but from some of the Impressions people had it sounded like again that the game was poised to you know maybe add more bosses over time or maybe add more heroes or more characters that you can play through the game with so it's possible that there will be like downloadable content or expansions to this game in the future that add more of that to kind of mix up the randomization a bit more or something like that and I really don't know what to make of this so far it sounds interesting from the way that it's laid out I mean I love Elden ring I can't I can't get enough Elden ring it's my favorite game of all time I'll say that hands down so I'm curious to see how this is I do like Rog likee games and I like games like CSE of the Dead gods or Ravens watch where you pick Heroes and you have to survive and take on bosses and it's difficult and it gets more and more challenging so I kind of think I'm intrigued by this mashup of different game mechanics but it's kind of yet to be seen how well it will work I mean from software is the best in the business at what they do so I'm not really worried about the quality of the game I'm simply wondering will it work in this type of setting I mean theoretically it should and even if I probably would have preferred like Elden Ring 2 or a prequel to Elden ring I think this is still definitely a game that's going to be very very interesting I think what I'm really curious about is the longevity of this game compared to something like dark souls or Elden ring like are people still going to be playing it years and years afterward is it going to keep getting updates are people going to burn out on it does he going to have PVP it doesn't sound like it from the way it's being designed PVP typically extends the life of these games so I have a lot of questions about this that I don't think are going to be answered immediately the game is supposedly coming out in 2025 we don't have a release date yet it's going to be available on PC Xbox last gen and current gen and Playstation last gen and current gen so it seems like it's going to running on the same engine as Elden ring and we don't really know like anything else other than that like when are we going to see more of this is there going to be you know some sort of play test or something like that in the future we don't really know so I don't know if it's going to come out in summer or fall like you know I think you can expect that it's probably not going to come out in q1 or anything like that because we're so close to that now we're probably not Q2 I think we're probably looking at you know June July or at least or at least those dates or later than that but I'm curious to know what you guys make of this so far I know when you hear elen ring you immediately get excited but are you excited for a completely different type of Elden ring taking the setting and sort of some of the combat mechanics and weapons and skills and stuff like that and setting it in a completely different type of game not Everyone likes Rogue likes or Rogue lights but they're pretty popular in general as a genre so I'm curious to see what you guys think is this something that you're excited for are you a bit bummed out by it where you expecting something else I want to hear from you let me know in the comments below w [Music] [Music]\n",

The scene is dramatic and atmospheric, reminiscent of Elden Ring.  The title \"Nightreign\" is boldly displayed, accompanied by the tagline \"Not What You Think.\"  The overall style is dark fantasy, cinematic, and evocative of powerful magic.\n",

A cloaked figure, possibly a wizard or sorcerer, stands on a rock formation in the distance, holding a staff or staff-like object. The figure's long white hair is visible. The title \"Not What You Think\" is prominently displayed in large, yellow letters, and the subtitle \"Gameplay Reaction\" is written in smaller yellow letters below it. The game's name, \"Elden Ring Night Reign\", is written in white letters at the top of the poster.\n",
